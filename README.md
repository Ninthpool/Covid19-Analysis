# An analysis of the spread of COVID-19 within the U.S. with a focus on confirmed cases and mortality rate using data science techniques
## -- Author:  Heming Wu

## Introduction:
Since the outbreak in Wuhan, China in January 2020, COVID-19 had devastated the world in an unpredented and catastrophic way. As of May 10th, there have been beyond 1.3 million coronavirus confirmed cases in the U.S. and more than eighty thousand lives were taken. With grief and curiosity, in this project, we would utlize various data science techniques (namely visualization, inference and predictions) to study the spread of COVID-19 within the U.S. in state and county level, with a focus on the growth of confirmed cases and the contributing featrues to a high mortality rate.

## Objective and question to address:
The focus of this project is to answer how the the COVID-19 spread within the U.S. by measuring count of confirmed cases and its growth with the help of basic visualization and descriptive statistics. As we reside in California, we'll also take emphasis in California and Alameda county and take a look at the situation there. The second question we want to address is what factors affect a U.S. county's COVID-19 mortality rate and if we can build a reasonably accurate model to predict a county's mortality rate based on these factors.
